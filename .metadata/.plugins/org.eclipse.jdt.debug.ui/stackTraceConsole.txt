Hello,

I'm a 2021 graduate from NIT Rourkela, I want to introduce myself as a potential candidate for this role. I'm actively looking for a job and I'm ready to relocate as well. 

I have 10+ months of Web development experience and an intermediate level of Data Structure and Algorithms knowledge.

Thanking you,
Abhijeet Kumar
